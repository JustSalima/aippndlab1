##Using a Pretrained Image Classifier
###Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program
This project focuses on using Python to use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds.  

Project Objectives:

Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives above.
Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives above, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.
